        My first favorite sport was baseball. I was allowed to play on my little brother's t-ball team, and that was the first oraganized team I was a part of. They called me lil' Mick because of my absurd batting
        percentage (pretty much 1.000, it was t-ball after all). But because of health concerns I was unabl to move on past that level. Many of my friends from when I was little went on to play baseball, and because
        I couldn't play and transferred schools, we grew apart. I didn't really sniff baseball again until I was called to serve in New England. My first area was in Littleton MA, just 30 min outside of Boston. While I was there,
        the Sox won the 2018 world series and my companion and I were lucky enough to see the team parade through town. Wow it was awesome! This lit a spark that grew into a love of the team. Since I've gotten home I have watched the Sox bounce
        back from a tough season to be in the race for a wild card spot in the Playoffs right now.
