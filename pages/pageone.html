    <h2>Why I Love the Jazz</h2>
    </div>
    <div class ='main-col-content'>
      I started watching the Jazz at a young age. They were the major professional sports team in Utah after all. As I grew up though, some health complications kept me from playing sports, which pushed me away from them altogether, including watching the Jazz.
      When I got to about middle school I was still n some meds that kept me away, but things were not as serious. I met a nice friend who loved basketball and invited me to come to basketball tryouts one day.
      I madde up some excuse to my mom and went behind her back. It was so much fun even though I was terrible. To my surprise I made the team! And even more surprising, mom let me play! That was the start of my love for basketball.
      During this time my dad was enjoying watching me play and tat rekindled his love for the Jazz. Christmas that year he got us tickets to see the Jazz in person. I was amazed at how impressive the palyers were. From there the rest is history.
      I became the biggest Jazz fan, and haven't missed watching a game since (minus the years I spent as a missionary).
