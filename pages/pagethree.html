    <h2>Why I bceame a Patriots fan when Brady Left</h2>
    </div>
    <div class ='main-col-content'>
        Of course because of my situation I as never allowed to play football. That plus the lack of professional teams in Utah meant that I really never cared to follow it.
        All I really knew about the NFL growing up is that the nobody liked Tom Brady and the Patriots. The people around me all but glued that into my head. I had never waatched a game but I hated them.
        Then I moved to NE and for the first time in my life, I met a patriots fan. And boy did they love their Pats. In fact, the pats won the super bowl while I was living there. The members of the church we were visiting the night
        of the game put a TV above my head so they could watch even though we were there. I found myself being proud of the Pats, but I couldn't bring myself to accept them as my team until I learned that Brady was on his way out.
        With the Pats looking at a rebuild for the first time in awhile, it was my time to jump on board without being a bandwagon.
